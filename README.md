    <h1>Image Captioning Project</h1>
    <p>This project aims to generate descriptive captions for images using deep learning techniques. It combines computer vision and natural language processing to create a model that can automatically generate captions for given images.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Data Preparation: </b>The Flickr8k dataset is used, which consists of images and corresponding captions.</li>
        <li><b>Feature Extraction: </b>The VGG16 model is utilized to extract visual features from the images. The pre-trained VGG16 model is used as a feature extractor, capturing high-level visual representations.</li>
        <li><b>Text Preprocessing: </b>The captions are cleaned and preprocessed by converting them to lowercase, removing unnecessary characters, and adding special tokens.</li>
        <li><b>Tokenization and Vocabulary Building: </b>The captions are tokenized, and a tokenizer is created to build the vocabulary. This step helps in representing words as numerical values for model input.</li>
        <li><b>Model Architecture: </b> The model architecture consists of an encoder and a decoder. The encoder takes in the image features, and the decoder generates the caption based on the encoded image features.</li>
        <li><b>Training: </b> The model is trained using the training dataset. A data generator is used to generate batches of input-output pairs for training. The model is trained using the captions and corresponding image features.</li>
        <li><b>Caption Generation: </b> Once the model is trained, it can generate captions for new images. Given an image, the model extracts features using the encoder, and then the decoder generates a caption based on the encoded features.</li>
        <li><b>Evaluation: </b>The generated captions are compared with the ground truth captions using evaluation metrics such as BLEU scores to measure the quality of the generated captions.</li>
    </ol>
